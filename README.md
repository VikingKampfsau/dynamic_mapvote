# Dynamic Mapvote

## Overview

A little test if it's possible to create a dynamic mapvote.
This is a menu based mapvote that auto updates it's iwd everytime the map ends.
That way the content of the mapvote is constantly changing without wasteing assets.

**I never used this in any of my mods so it's not tested on a live server yet
**Full source included

## Installation

Install cod4x and add the required plugins to it.
Copy the mod to your mods folder - if you already have an older version then remove it.

Add the content of the example config to your server config.

## How to add more maps

Add the map to config - dvar "sv_voteable_maps".
Add the loadscreen.iwi file to \mapvote\images folder.
