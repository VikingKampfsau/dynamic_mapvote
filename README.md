# Dynamic Mapvote

## Overview

A little test if it's possible to create a dynamic mapvote.
This is a menu based mapvote that auto updates it's iwd everytime the map ends.
That way the content of the mapvote constantly changing without wasteing assets.

**Since i never really used this in any of my mods or projects i did really finish this 100%.
**Maybe i will do this in future but don't count on it.

## Installation

Install cod4x and add the required plugins to it.
Copy the mod to your mods folder - if you already have an older version then remove it.
